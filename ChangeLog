Version 2.2
    Prepare for releasing to Open Source, includes Debianizing.

Version 2.1
    Allow non-K&R 'const' in K&R-style function definitions (yuck).

Version 2.0
    Parse destructor names properly for functions implemented
    within their class definitions.

    Support declarations of classes within functions and functions
    within classes, recursively.

    Add -f and -F options to enable per-file statistics printing.

    Add -V option to get the current version number.

    Add -n option to calculate non-commented source lines directly.
    Output format compatible with 'anac'.

    Count C-preprocessor lines properly with -d and -n options,
    previously was not counting them as non-commented lines.

    Keep track of # statements in a file which are outside the scope
    of functions (e.g., variable declarations).

    Parsing 'struct foo function() {return;}' and some related
    constructs used to confuse the parser -- fixed.

    Remove a bunch of dead code.

    More consistent error messages.
