 <b>NAME</b>
      pmccabe - calculate McCabe cyclomatic complexity for C and C++
      programs

 <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
      <b>pmccabe</b> <b>[-vdCbtT?]</b> <b>[file(s)]</b>


 <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
      <em>pmccabe</em> processes the named files, or standard input if none are
      named, calculating statistics including McCabe cyclomatic complexity
      for each function found.  The files are expected to be either C (ANSI
      or K&amp;R) or C++.


      <b>-?</b>   Print an informative usage message.

      <b>-v</b>   Print column headers

      <b>-d</b>   Intended to help count non-commented source lines via something
           like:

           pmccabe -d *.c | grep -v '^[&lt;blank&gt;&lt;tab&gt;]*$' | wc -l

           Comments and cpp directives are removed, string literals are
           replaced by <b>STRINGLITERAL</b>, character constants are replaced by
           <b>CHARLITERAL</b>.  The resulting source code is much easier to parse.
           This is the first step performed by <em>pmccabe</em> so that its parser
           can be simpler.

      <b>-C</b>   Custom output format - don't use it.

      <b>-b</b>   Output format compatible with <em>softbuild</em>.  Numerical sorting on
           this format is possible using:

           sort -n +1 -t%

      <b>-t</b>   Print column totals.  Note the total number of lines is *NOT* the
           number of non-commented source lines - in fact it may not be very
           useful at all.

      <b>-T</b>   Print column totals *ONLY*.


    <b>Parsing</b>
      <em>pmccabe</em> ignores all <em>cpp</em> preprocessor directives - calculating the
      complexity of the appearance of the code rather than the complexity
      after the preprocessor mangles the code.  This is especially important
      since simple things like <em>getchar</em>(3) expand into macros which increase
      complexity.

    <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>
      A line is written to standard output for each function found of the
      form:


           5       6       11      34      27      gettoken.c(35): matchparen

      Column 1 contains cyclomatic complexity calculated by adding 1 (for
      the function) to the occurences of <b>for</b>, <b>if</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>switch</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, <b>||</b>, and
      <b>?</b>.  Unlike "normal" McCabe cyclomatic complexity, each case in a
      switch statement is not counted as additional complexity.  This
      treatment of switch statements and complexity may be more useful than
      the "normal" measure for judging maintenance effort and code
      difficulty.

      Column 2 is the cyclomatic complexity calculated in the "usual" way
      with regard to switch statements.  Specifically it is calculated as in
      column 1 but counting each <b>case</b> rather than the <b>switch</b> and may be more
      useful than column 1 for judging testing effort.

      Column 3 contains a statement count.  It is calculated by adding each
      occurence of <b>for</b>,<b>if</b>,<b>while</b>, <b>switch</b>, and semicolon within the function.
      One possible surprise is that <b>for</b> statements have a minimum statement
      count of 3.  This is realistic since <b>for(A;</b> <b>B;</b> <b>C){...}</b> is really
      shorthand for

        A;
        while (B)
        {
          ...
          C;
        }

      Column 4 contains the first line number in the function.  This is not
      necessarily the same line on which the function name appears.

      Column 5 is the number of lines of the function, from the number in
      column 4 through the line containing the closing curly brace.

      The final column contains the file name, line number on which the
      function name occurs, and the name of the function.

 <b>APPLICATIONS</b>
      The obvious application of <em>pmccabe</em> is illustrated by the following
      which gives a list of the "top ten" most complex functions:


           pmccabe *.c | sort -nr | head -10

      Many files contain more than one C function and sometimes it would be
      useful to extract each function separately.  <b>matchparen()</b> (see example

      output above) can be extracted from gettoken.c by extracting 27 lines
      starting with line 34.  This can form the basis of tools which operate
      on functions instead of files (e.g., use as a front-end for <em><a href="/cgi-bin/man?1+diff">diff</em>(1)</a>).

 <b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
      <em>pmccabe</em> returns a nonzero exit status if any errors occur during
      parsing.

      Error messages to standard error, usually explaining that the parser
      is confused about something, mimic normal C compiler error messages.

 <b>WARNINGS</b>
      <em>pmccabe</em> is confused by unmatched curly braces or parentheses which
      sometimes occur with hasty use of <em>cpp</em> directives.  In these cases a
      diagnostic is printed and the complexity results for the files named
      may be unreliable.  Most times the "#ifdef" directives may be modified
      such that the curly braces match.  Note that if <em>pmccabe</em> is confused by
      a <em>cpp</em> directive, most pretty printers will be too.  In some cases,
      preprocessing with <em><a href="/cgi-bin/man?1+unifdef">unifdef</em>(1)</a> may be appropriate.

      Treatment of <b>?</b>  for statement counting could perhaps be improved.

      Statement counting could arguably be improved by: counting occurences
      of the comma operator, multiple assignments, assignments within
      conditional tests, and logical conjunction.

      Destructors implemented within class definitions have no '~' in their
      name.
